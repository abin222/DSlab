# Implement the graph data structure with the following functions: 
#     • Find the degree/indegree/outdegree of the given node
#     • Find out DFS tree with respect to given source node and calculate the length of largest path 
#     • Find out BFS tree with respect to given source node and calculate the length of largest path
#     • Find out the connected components strongly connected components of the given undirected graph/directed graph
#     • Find out the shortest path (ie., the path with minimum path cost) between two nodes
#     • Find out the longest path (ie., the path with maximum path cost) between two nodes
#     • Check whether given graph is simple graph
