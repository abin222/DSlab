# You are given a sequence of n songs where the ith song is `i minutes long. You
# want to place all of the songs on an ordered series of CDs (e.g. CD 1, CD 2, CD
# 3,â€¦., CDk) where each CD can hold m minutes. Furthermore,
# (1) The songs must be recorded in the given order, song 1, song 2, . . . , song n.
# (2) All songs must be included.
# (3) No song may be split across CDs.
# Your goal is to determine how to place them on the CDs as to minimize the
# number of CDs needed. Give the most efficient algorithm you can to find an
# optimal solution for this problem, prove the algorithm is correct and analyze the
# time complexity.
